Series of self-notes/scripts relating to [Poudriere](https://github.com/freebsd/poudriere),
FreeBSD's primary tool for testing, building and distributing
packages.

- [SETUP](SETUP.md) - quickstart guide.
- [SCRIPTS](SCRIPTS.md) - adhoc frontend scripts.

These guides are simply for my own personal reference
and as such should not be taken as a source of truth.
